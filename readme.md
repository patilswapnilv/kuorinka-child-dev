# Kuorinka Child Dev

Short description of your theme. This is development and example child theme for Kuorinka parent theme. 

## Understanding Kuorinka

The [Kuorinka](https://foxland.fi/downloads/kuorinka) parent theme is combination of [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) theme, some of my own experience and some files and ideas from
[Hybrid Core](http://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core). Note that theme doesn't use Hybrid Core, only some files from it.

Kuorinka theme is accessibility-ready and translation-ready, have right to left support and includes [Schema.org](http://schema.org) microdata.
I expect that child theme do not break those things. For example check color contrast with [Joe Dolson tool](https://www.joedolson.com/tools/color-contrast.php)
so you can keep accessibility-ready tag.

## Translations

All child themes should have a `/languages/theme-slug.pot` file. Even if your theme doesn't add new strings, the `style.css` headers should be translatable.

If you're unfamiliar with this process, here are tutorials for creating a POT file:

* [Creating pot files](https://foxland.fi/creating-pot-file-for-your-theme-or-plugin/)
* [Language packs](http://ottopress.com/2013/language-packs-101-prepwork)
* [Create pot file using Grunt task](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-wp-i18n)
